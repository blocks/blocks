Hi!  👋
We’re excited that you’re interested in contributing!
Take a moment to read the following guidelines.
And thanks for contributing to **Blocks**!  👏👌✨

## Getting started

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/blocks/blocks
cd blocks
yarn
```

Then, run the docs site:

```sh
yarn start
```

The docs site includes a demo page which is a great way to get
started making changes to the editor itself.

Docs pages themselves are located in `src/pages`. All types of
docs contributions are very welcome!

## How to contribute?

Before undergoing a substantial to docs or the codebase, please
open up an issue to make sure it's a desired change. We don't want
you to put in lots of time for something that isn't part of this
project's goals.

We're working on formalizing the roadmap for **Blocks**, to make 
the path to contributing a little bit clearer. 

For now, good places to look at are the
[issues](https://github.com/blocks/blocks/issues) and the 
[roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/blocks/projects/1).

If you're keen on the design side of things there's a
[Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/7CeIPXhJJudZvq5ofmfx5p/Blocks-UI).

Reporting bugs that have not been issued yet also helps!
