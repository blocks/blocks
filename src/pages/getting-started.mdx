# Getting started

While Blocks is in alpha, the recommended way to get started is to
use the demo.

[Try the demo &rarr;](/demo/)

If you're a pioneering type and want to experiment with the editor in
other projects you can continue on:

## Installation

Install the library and its peer dependencies:

```js
yarn add blocks-ui @mdx-js/react @blocks/react
```

## Usage

You can use the block editor with the built-in blocks by only passing
a JSX source string:

```js
import React from 'react'
import Editor from 'blocks-ui'

const JSX = `
import React from 'react'
import { HeaderBasic } from '@blocks/react'

export default () => (
  <Blocks.Root>
    <HeaderBasic>
      <HeaderBasic.Logo to="/">Hello</HeaderBasic.Logo>
      <HeaderBasic.Nav>
        <HeaderBasic.Link to="/about">About</HeaderBasic.Link>
        <HeaderBasic.Link to="/blog">Blog</HeaderBasic.Link>
        <HeaderBasic.Link to="/contact">Contact</HeaderBasic.Link>
      </HeaderBasic.Nav>
    </HeaderBasic>
  </Blocks.Root>
)
`

export default () => <Editor src={JSX} />
```
