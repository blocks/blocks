# How it works

Blocks is a parser, transformer, and renderer/compiler.

It's unique because it reads in valid, production-ready JSX code
and treats the AST as its data structure. Information is _queried_
from the AST and then changes to the canvas _transform_ the AST.

It uses Babel and its plugin API for parsing and transforming.
Events that happen in the canvas are emitted and run corresponding
plugins on the source code.

**Note**: _Blocks is still extremely alpha software so a wide array
of optimizations and other enhancements are missing which includes
maintaining the source as the AST structure rather than a JSX string
and maintaining an internal representation for rendering after the
first inline function evaluation_.

## Preparing the source code

Blocks essentially maintains two states of the source code internally.
One is a slight transform from the original source code with a UUID added.
This is used to determine what JSX elements to modify. The second state
of source code is the transformed version which is used to render the
canvas.

### Internal representation

The internal representation of the source code looks pretty similar to
what was passed in. The only noticeable change is the addition of a
UUID that's passed as a prop (`___uuid`).

#### Input

```js
import React from 'react'
import Blocks from 'blocks-ui/components'

export default () => (
  <Blocks.Root>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  </Blocks.Root>
)
```

#### Output

```js
import React from 'react'
import Blocks from 'blocks-ui/components'

export default () => (
  <Blocks.Root>
    <h1 ___uuid="123abc">Hello, world!</h1>
  </Blocks.Root>
)
```

### Renderable representation

The render transform takes the internal representation and
then does the following:

- converts JSX to function calls (using the Blocks pragma)
- replaces `Blocks.Root` with a special `BLOCKS_Root` for drag and drop
- injects the implementation of `BLOCKS_Root`
- removes imports
- rewrites the default export to be a `BLOCKS_Container` variable
- rewrites all named exports to be variable declarations
- wraps all blocks on the canvas in the draggable implementation

#### Input

```js
import React from 'react'
import Blocks from 'blocks-ui/components'

export default () => (
  <Blocks.Root>
    <h1 ___uuid="123abc">Hello, world!</h1>
  </Blocks.Root>
)
```

#### Output

```js
TODO
```

## Rendering the canvas

After the transform for a renderable output, Blocks uses a
custom pragma, AST metadata, custom scope (including blocks
passed to the editor) and inline function evaluation
to render the canvas.

### Pragma

Blocks uses its own custom pragma which is used when rendering
to the canvas. This is used for handling the UUID, element
selection, and styling based on selection/hover/focus state.

It's a light wrapper around Theme UI's custom pragma. It's
rough implementation looks something like:

```jsx
export default elementSelectionHandler => (type, props, ...children) => {
  // Grab the current selected element from context
  const element = useElement() || {}

  props = props || {}
  const { ___uuid: id, sx = {} } = props
  delete props.___uuid

  const isCurrentElement = id && id === element.id

  return jsx(
    type,
    {
      ...props,
      sx: {
        ...sx,
        boxShadow: isCurrentElement
          ? 'inset 0px 0px 0px 2px #0079FF'
          : sx.boxShadow
      },
      onClick: e => {
        e.stopPropagation()
        if (id) {
          elementSelectionHandler(id)
        }
      }
    },
    ...children
  )
}
```

### Renderer

The renderer itself receives the transformed source code
and the scope of the canvas and its Blocks. Then, it initializes
a function and evaluates it inline:

```js
const fn = new Function(
  'React',
  ...Object.keys(scope),
  `${code};
  return React.createElement(BLOCKS_Container)`
)

return fn(React, ...Object.values(scope))
```

This is wrapped up in a component so the API is nicer:

```js
<InlineRender scope={scope} code={transformedCode} theme={theme} />
```

### Querying element information

In addition to Babel transforms, Blocks needs to query information
from the AST in order to query information about a selected element.
Blocks uses information including:

- element name
- parent UUID
- child names and UUIDs
- text (if all children are text nodes)

In order to achieve this, a Babel plugin is run to search for a
JSX element with a matching UUID and then pulling information from
the node in the AST.

```js
{
  JSXOpeningElement: path => {
    const id = path.node.attributes.find(
      // uuidName is the matching uuid property and it's equal to ___uuid
      node => node && node.name && node.name.name === uuidName
    )

    if (!id || id.value.value !== elementId) {
      return
    }

    const children = path.container.children || []
    const hasElements = children.some(n => !t.isJSXText(n))

    const element = {
      id: elementId,
      name: getElementName(path.node),
      props: getElementProps(path.node.attributes),
      parentId: getParentId(path)
    }

    // ...
  }
}
```

In addition to the current element, Blocks queries other metadata
from the AST including imports, exports, and the Blocks for the
canvas.

Queries are wrapped up into a `queries` module which can be used
like so:

```js
queries.getCurrentElement(code, elementId)
```

## Returning new JSX

The new, modified JSX code is returned in an `onChange` event.
It takes the internal representation of the JSX and runs a
Babel plugin to remove the UUID and any other Blocks metadata.
This results in

#### Input

```js
import React from 'react'
import Blocks from 'blocks-ui/components'

export default () => (
  <Blocks.Root>
    <h1
      ___uuid="123abc"
      sx={{
        color: 'tomato'
      }}
    >
      Hello, world!
    </h1>
  </Blocks.Root>
)
```

#### Output

```js
import React from 'react'
import Blocks from 'blocks-ui/components'

export default () => (
  <Blocks.Root>
    <h1 sx={{ color: 'tomato' }}>Hello, world!</h1>
  </Blocks.Root>
)
```
