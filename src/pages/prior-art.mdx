# Prior art

Blocks didn't come out of a vacuum. There are a lot of projects that
have provided inspiration in one way or another. Below begins a list
(not intended to be comprehensive):

- **Compositor**: The lab where a lot of these ideas were formed
- **Framer**: Property controls for components and bringing in existing
          components into a design tool
- **Storybook**: Knobs, dials, and docs generation
- **Webflow**: #nocode
- **Gutenberg**: What's likely _the_ most popular block editor and ecosystem
- **Alva**: React component-based WYSIWYG
